            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Effervescent</p><!--Change it to the name of the company-->

Effervescent’s products originate from artisan hand-crafted methods and we now specialize in selling items including candles, hand soaps, body butter, bath bombs, and more. We feature seven unique scents for each of our products. It is essential that all our products are cruelty-free and do not challenge any of our ethical values in the process of creation. Our mission is to make natural and organic body and beauty products more accessible and available to all.</p><!--Short description of the company-->
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>Our products are catered to people who want to get more involved in healthy and natural skin-care routines but do not know where to start. The target market is individuals age 15-25, particularly those in Gen Z, <a href="https://www.wgsn.com/assets/marketing/emails/2019/beauty/launch/Beauty_Whitepaper_Digital.pdf">as trends in the industry</a> show that “29% of US consumers aged 18-21 claim the word “vegan” on products makes them more appealing, compared to just 14% of Boomers.”
</p><!-- Who are the people who use this site? -->
           
            <p>These individuals’ primary tasks and goals involve bettering the environment through working on finding the best skincare and body product options for them. With the increase in scientific research regarding the negative effects of artificial material and chemicals in certain beauty products, it is important that the consumers are aware of what they are putting on their skin.</p><!-- What are their primary task and goals? -->
