         <h2>Native Plants</h2>
         <p>Plants can be native to large or small areas. Some plants grow throughout the Western United States; some grow only in California; some grow only in certain areas within California or within San Luis Obispo County. So, what does a “native” plant really mean? Generally we use the term “California native” for a plant that is from and grows in California. For San Luis Obispo-collected plants, we note the collection site.</p>
         <p>Restoration plants preferably are collected from the area needing to be restored. This maintains any genetic uniqueness to that area. However, most homeowners or landscapers won’t have the luxury of site-collected plants for their yard. GGF has a plant bank of SLO County native plants. We are able to collect in a number of local areas thanks to our partnerships.</p>
         <p>Native plants have several benefits to both gardeners and wildlife. In the garden, they are generally well-adapted to our usual climate. This means less water and less care. Natives often need little to no water by their third year in the ground. They usually grow in our soil without amendments. For budget-minded gardeners, natives can be long-term cost-savers.</p>
         <p>Local wildlife also benefits from locally-collected plants. Butterflies, birds, insects, and animals rely on native plants for food, shelter, and nesting material. Introduced plants may not have the same characteristics that our native fauna needs to live.</p>
         <!--</div>-->
         <h2>Succulents</h2>
         <p>Succulents and cactus bring interesting colors and textures to any low-water garden. Our selection ranges from groundcover sedums through upright cacti and locally-collected native Dudleya.</p>
         <h2>Drought Tolerant</h2>
         <p>Drought tolerant plants are those that can survive periods of little to no water. However, they may not look pretty without water. Some natives are stress deciduous and will drop their leaves if they go without water for any length of time. Other plants grow slowly and flower less. The advantage to plants with low water needs is that you will drastically reduce your water usage. Many people are replacing lawns with lower-growing thymes, sedums, or native grasses and seeing their water bills drop.</p>

         <h2>Plant Information</h2>
         <h3>Sales Policies</h3>
         <p>We are a wholesale nursery and do not sell directly to the public except on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can access a list of local nurseries that carry our products by clicking here.</p>
         <h3>Master Plant List</h3>
         <p>We are developing our online master plant list. Until that time, refer to the Availability list for plants currently available.</p>
         <h3>SLO County Plant Bank</h3>
         <p>According to www.answers.com, a seed bank is “an organization dedicated to keeping old varieties of plants alive and available to breeders and gardeners by preserving seeds of these plants.” Seed banks are also used for long-term preservation of plant species.</p>
         <p>Not all seeds can be stored, and not all gardeners can start plants from seed. Native plants, in particular, can be challenging to germinate. Growing Grounds decided to create a living plant bank to better serve our community. We wanted people to be able to plant natives from their area into their yards. While we cannot collect in every person’s backyard, we can send Los Osos-collected plants back to nurseries & landscapers in Los Osos, or Atascadero-collected plants back to Atascadero. This is one way we are promoting the genetic uniqueness and viability of our local ecosystems.</p>
         <p>We have the opportunity to collect seeds and cuttings in a number of different locations. Each group of plants is labeled with the collection site or other pertinent data that allows us to ship plants to the most appropriate area.</p>
