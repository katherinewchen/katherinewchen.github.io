Two of the County’s largest non-profit restoration organizations contract with us yearly to provide plants for their restoration efforts.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo</li>
            <li>Althouse and Meade Inc.</li>
            <li>City of Atascadero</li>

            <li>Morro Coast Audubon Society</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Grants</h2>
         <h3>The Hind Foundation</h3>
         <p>Through a grant from the Hind Foundation Growing Grounds Farm was able to refurbish all  three of our greenhouses and install metal benches, micro-tubing bench heating systems, and mist controllers throughout. As a result of these upgrades our propagation efforts increased from several thousand plants per year to nearly 30,000 plants in 2010. Many of these are difficult to find California natives derived from locally collected seeds and cuttings.</p>
         <h3>Clif Foundation</h3>
         <p>A grant from the Clif Family Foundation paid for improvements to our acid injection system. This system measures the pH of the water and adds amendments to improve water quality. The Clif Foundation grant improved the system so pH can be calibrated to within .2 of a desired target and maintains that range under variable flow rates yielding healthier plants and less reliance on chemical fertilizers.</p>
         <h3>United Way</h3>
         <p>United Way grants help support the program in a variety of ways providing 200 to 400 additional work shifts per year at the Farm providing employment opportunities for over 200 individuals.</p>
         <h3>Human Relations Commission of San Luis Obispo County</h3>
         <p>The HRC of San Luis Obispo supports the Farm through a grant used to fund over 100 paid positions yearly.</p>
         <h3>PG&E</h3>
         <p>Pacific Gas and Electric has provided grant funding for the construction of our third greenhouse and improvements in our water storage capacity. In a major effort to reduce the operating costs of the nursery, PG&E also helped fund the acquisition and installation of a grid tied 3 kilowatt photovoltaic array that has significantly reduced our yearly energy bill.</p>
