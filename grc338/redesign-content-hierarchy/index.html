        <h2>Hope Through Horticulture: Nurturing Plants and People</h2>
        
        <p>Growing Grounds Farm is a non-profit wholesale nursery located in San Luis Obispo, halfway between Los Angeles and San Francisco. In business since 1984, Growing Grounds offers California natives, Mediterranean perennials, succulents, restoration and mitigation plants, a wide variety of grasses, and a selection of perennial herbs. <br>
        <br>
        We are a wholesale nursery and do not sell directly to the public except on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of each month from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. A list of local nurseries that carry our products can be accessed by clicking here.<br>
        <br>
        Most of our nursery stock thrives in the moderately wet winters and warm dry summers of California’s Mediterranean climate zone. We offer a wide variety of plants that are locally grown and genetically adapted to local conditions. We hope to inspire an appreciation of local flora and encourage climate-appropriate gardening. This benefits the consumer by reducing water usage and cost. <br>
        <br>
        As a Green business, we have installed solar panels to help run our well. We installed drip line for all of our 5 gallon and larger stock, saving thousands of gallons of water each year. Growing Grounds believes that the outside of homes and businesses should be as green as the inside and promotes wise planting.<br>
        <br>
        Our partnership with local restoration groups, such as the Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo and the Morro Coast Audubon Society, allows us to collect seeds and cuttings from different areas around the county. The plant bank established by these efforts provides for site specific restoration. It also helps insure the genetic diversity of several native species within the county. <br>
