        <h2>Volunteer Opportunities</h2>
             <p>Growing Grounds Farm relies on the efforts of a broad spectrum of community volunteers for the completion of large projects, ongoing maintenance as well as the augmentation daily operational tasks. There are many ways to volunteer at Growing Grounds Farm from one time spur of the moment efforts to ongoing long term volunteering and everything in between.</p>
        
        <h3>Single or Small Group Volunteers</h3>
            <p>Most volunteer efforts take place during the normal working hours from 9:00 to 1:00 Tuesday through Friday. With as little advance notice as one day, a person can come to the Farm and participate in a normal work day, working side by side with Farm employees. Long term volunteers can arrange specific days and times with Farm management and can participate in infrastructure creation and maintenance, daily operations, and special projects. Growing Grounds Farm also serves as a location for those who need to fulfill court ordered community service, or community service for section 8 housing. Please contact the Farm to arrange a tour and to discuss scheduling.</p>
        
        <h3>Large Group Volunteers</h3>
            <p>With advance notice, the Farm can accommodate larger groups of up to 100 volunteers. We have in the past hosted church groups, Rotary and Kiwanis groups, United Way Make a Difference Day, Eagle Scouts and many others. Large groups are usually scheduled for either Saturday or Sunday and Farm staff is present to direct and facilitate volunteer efforts.</p>
