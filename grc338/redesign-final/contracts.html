         <h2>Contract Growing</h2>

         <h3>Lead Times</h3>
         <p>Lead times depend on the plant. Some plants can be ready in as little as 8 weeks. Other varieties need a year or more to grow to sellable size. If you need site collection, lead time may be up to 2 years for some species.</p>
         <h3>Site Collection</h3>
         <p>Growing Grounds can do site collection for some projects. When collecting seed or cuttings on site, there can be narrow windows of opportunity. Seeds are often available only at certain times of year. Other plants can have cuttings harvested only at certain times.</p>
